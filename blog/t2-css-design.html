        WHAT ARE BEST PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH USING CLASSES vs IDS?
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have many things that need the same styling, you should use a class. This way you can save yourself the time and trouble of applying the same rules to several selectors. 

        How about this example: I am making a website. I want to have icons that link to my different social media sites. Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

        I want all three elements to be sized in the same way but for some reason, my Facebook icon is a little bigger that the other two.

        So I think ID's are easier to understand. You have a million images or div's and you want to call on a specific one in your CSS file. Giving one an special ID name make it easy to do that. So let's see how you would use ID's for the example above:

            ![ID's Only--HTML](t2-css-design-images/image-1.png)

        IDs are unique. Each element can only have one ID and each page can have only one element with that ID. 

        So this is what you would maybe see in your CSS file. 

            ![ID's Only--CSS](t2-css-design-images/image-2.png)


        Classes are not unique; they are general. You can use the same class on multiple elements on the same page and you can use multiple classes on the same element. See the HTML below:

            ![Classes--HTML](t2-css-design-images/image-3.png)

            ![Classes--CSS](t2-css-design-images/image-4.png)
