      <p>To me, stereotype threat is just a fancy term social psychologists gave to a small section of the greater phenomenon known as "feeling shitty about yourself affects your ability to perform". Not everyone has had equal experiences with stereotype threat, but I can't think of anyone who hasn't been victim to, witnessed, and taken advantage of the greater phenomenon. Even the dominant majority can relate to that, which is why I think it is a much more important topic.
      </p>
      <p>Stereotype threat was born from a study in the 90's that showed that smart, well-prepared, and motivated black kids performed worser on standardized tests than equally smart, well-prepared, and motivated white kids, when race was emphasized beforehand. These findings were then replicated for women and men, when gender was emphasized, and also for low-income 7th-graders and their wealthier peers when socioeconomic status was emphasized. But guess what, positive stereotypes can also threaten performance. Asian American women choked on their math test when they were reminded that Asians are expected to be greatat math compared to other races. Surprised? I'm not.
      </p>
      <p>We won't eradicate stereotypes altogether, but we can and should focus on what we can control: our own personal beliefs.Other people saying you can't or shouldn't be able to do something is only an issue if you have pre-existing doubts about your abilities to do that thing. Suddenly, that whispering fear becomes the loudest voice in your head and it's hard to focus. For example, I've been driving my car in San Francisco for 4.5 years. I am both female and Asian, which stereotypically makes me a mobile danger on the road. But the facts are that I've parallel parked thousands of times and have never been in an accident, so stereotypes about my ability don't phase me whatsoever. They hit my armor like beads of water. I barely hear them. However, stereotypes about women not being able to negotiate? Well, I have very little experience with negotiating and I am a woman...so maybe it's true. My lack of confidence means I have no protection against the ideas the outside world projects onto me. And suddenly, I am worried about failing.
      </p>
      <p>The point is, if you are worrying about failing it means your focusing on failing, and that usually means you're more likely to fail. Self-fulling prophecies: it's is a real thing. But if you're truly confident, even delusionally so, you're thinking about kicking ass instead, and you'll probably be more likely to kick ass than getting ass kicked. You know what study I'd like to see? A study which shows enhanced performance from people targeted by a negative stereotype simply because they're thinking about being the exception to the rule. Before taking that test, maybe those same black kids in that original study are reminded of the successful role models from their stereotyped group, the great and celebrated black intellectuals like Neil deGrasse Tyson and ####. Oh wait...that study HAS been done already.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-head">My suggestion, fuck everyone else. Do you.</p>
      <p>The solution may be difficult but it is totally up to you. If you surround yourself with exceptions to the rule and don't spend your time thinking about what the outside world expects you to be, you'll be better for it. You decide who your friends are. You choose who your mentors are. You pick your role models. You define the way you live. So be smart and surround yourself with the good shit, not the bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>Have I felt stereotype threat? Of course. For being a woman, for attending a public high school, for being Chinese, for studying my major, for being an American, the list goes on... But nothing has been worse to me, my performance, and my idea of self-worth than my family's belief that you cannot be successful without PhD. (I don't have my PhD and I probably never will.) It isn't about stereotype threat really, it's about identifying why you're letting other people's expectations affect you, and working at what you do have control over: your own personal beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>When I was accepted into MIT, many of my high school classmates told me that it was only because I was a girl. (I actually think one of my teachers made a similar comment.) At that time though, I had absolutely no idea what they were alluding to and the comment went over my head completely. When I got to MIT, I did some leadership program and at one point, all the girls were asked to take a step forward if we had ever been told that our gender was the reason why we got into MIT. Every single girl stepped forward. I looked around and thought, "This is so weird. What a strange coincidence..." Let me explain. My mom, my sister, my soccer coach, my lacrosse coach, my piano teacher, and my guidance couselor were all examples of strong female leaders. I grew up blissfully ignorant to the fact that in some places in the world, women are thought to be lesser than men. Men and women were 100% equal in my mind in terms of academics and intelligence so gender inequality and affirmative action for women wasn't something I was even aware of. Thus, that stereotype threat couldn't touch me because my own personal beliefs did not allow it to. I also grew up believing that you should be passionate about your career and make meaningful contributions to society through research and educating the next generation. I grew up believing that the most noble, highly-valued, and satisfying profession anyone could possibly have was to be an academic research scientist and professor. Why? Because everyone in my family believed that. And guess what, I've lived the majority of my life fearing the consequences of not taking up the family business.
      </p>
      <p>This fear has honestly paralyzed me for years. It interfered with my ability to perform, and it has also attacked my core happiness, confidence, and sense of identity. And then one day, I realized that I there were many other ways to be happy and do great things in the world. What I'm trying to say is that, there are millions of stereotypes floating around in the world but  only a few that exist in your personal world. The problem isn't that there are stereotypes, the problem is that you've allowed a few into your pscyhe to grow, fester, and ultimately take you down.
      </p>
      <p>The reason why I had no desire to do Hackbright (an all-women programming bootcamp) was because, to me, it focuses on the fact that women need special attention in order make it in this male-dominated tech industry. While I respect their mission and understand how it serves to build confidence in women who might need stronger armor, I prefer to continue being blissfully ignorant about the fact that there are gender equality issues at all. I will continue to surround myself with exceptions to the rule and not worry about failing because delusional or not, I choose what I believe. I do me and you do you. We all have our own stories and personal beliefs, so the real take home here is to make sure you're focusing on what you believe first and worry about what everyone else believes second.
