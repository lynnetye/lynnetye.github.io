    <h1>Don't Sweat the Stereotypes</h1>
    <h2>The whole problem is that you care too much about them</h2>

      <p>To me, stereotype threat is just a fancy term social psychologists gave to a small section of the greater phenomenon known as "feeling shitty about yourself affects your ability to perform". I can't think of anyone who hasn't been victim to, witnessed, and taken advantage of that. Even the dominant majority can relate to that.
      </p>
      <p>I won't fight the existence of stereotypes (power to you if you do) but I will rally those around me to direct our attention to power of our personal beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>Regardless of the stereotype, it's a matter of what you personally believe to be true. Other people saying you can't or shouldn't be able to is only a problem if it picks at your own nagging doubts about your ability. If you have a quiet but persistent voice in your head that is creating fears of failure, that is the bigger problem. I've been driving my car in San Francisco for 4.5 years. I am both female and Asian. And the facts are that I've parallel parked thousands of times and have never been in an accident, so stereotypes about my ability to drive hit my armor like beads of water. But stereotypes about starting a company without an MBA? Whether I want to believe them or not, I can't ignore them because somewhere inside of me, I do question how capable I am as an entrepreneur...
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-head">Turns out, it's not just negative stereotypes that can be evil.
      </p>
      <p>The original study in the 90's showed that smart, well-prepared, and motivated black kids performed worser on standardized tests than equally smart, well-prepared, and motivated white kids, when race was emphasized beforehand. These findings were then replicated for women and men, when gender was emphasized, and also for low-income 7th-graders and their wealthier peers when socioeconomic status was emphasized. But guess what, positive stereotypes can also threaten performance. Asian American women choked on their math test when they were reminded that Asians are supposed to be great at math! Surprised? I'm not.
      </p>
      <p>The point is, if you are worrying about failing it means your focusing on failing, and that usually means you're more likely to fail. You know what study I'd like to see? A study which shows enhanced performance from people targeted by a negative stereotype but are reminded of successful role models from the stereotyped group. For example, reminding the same black kids of great and celebrated black intellects before taking that test. Oh wait...that study already exists.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-head">The solution may not be an easy one but it is absolutely up in your hands.</p>
      <p>If you surround yourself with exceptions to the rule and don't spend your time thinking about what the outside world expects you to be able to do and who you're supposed to be, you'll be better for it. You decide who your friends are. You choose who your mentors are. You pick your role models. You define the way you live. So be smart and surround yourself with the good shit, not the bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>Have I felt stereotype threat? Of course. For being a woman, for attending a public high school, for being Chinese, for studying my major, for being an American, the list goes on... But nothing has been worse to me, my performance, and my idea of self-worth than my family's belief that you cannot be successful without PhD. (I don't have my PhD and I probably never will.) It isn't about stereotype threat really, it's about identifying why you're letting other people's expectations affect you.
      </p>When I was accepted into MIT, many of my high school classmates told me that it was because I was a girl. I actually think one of my teachers said it too. At that time though, I had absolutely no idea what they were alluding to and the comment went over my head completely. My mom, my sister, my soccer coach, my lacrosse coach, my piano teacher, and my guidance couselor were all examples of strong female leaders so I was just blissfully ignorant to the fact that in some places in the world, women are thought to be lesser than men. Men and women were 100% equal in my mind in terms of academics and intelligence so gender inequality and affirmative action for women wasn't something I was even aware of. Thus, that stereotype threat that couldn't touch me because my own personal beliefs did not allow it to. My personal beliefs also led me to believe that the most noble, highly-valued, and satisfying profession anyone could have was to be an academic professor. Why? Because everyone in my family took that path.
      </p>
      <p>The reason why I had no desire to do Hackbright was because, to me, it focuses on the fact that women need special attention in order make it in this male-dominated world of computer programming. While I respect this mission and understand how it serves to build confidence in women who might need the extra armor, I prefer to continue being blissfully ignorant and never know that I was supposed to be afraid to ask for what I want simply because I'm a woman.  We all have our own stories and personal beliefs, so the real take home here is to make sure you're listening to yours first before anyone else's.
