      <p>When I started at Dev Bootcamp, I was asked to identify what my thinking and learning style was based on Anthony Gregorc's theory of the "mind style". In this model, there are four styles, each with its own set of characteristics and qualities. They are: Concrete Sequential (CS), Abstract Sequential (AS), Abstract Random (AR), Concrete Random (CR). I am most strongly a Concrete Random thinker (followed by Abstract Random, but let's not get into that here).</p>
      <p class="paragraph-head">What's it like being a Concrete Random?</p>
      <ul>Concrete Randoms...</ul>
        <li>Get the gist of ideas quickly</li>
        <li>Are able to make intuitive leaps (skipping steps in problem solving)</li>
        <li>Prefer a trial and error approach</li>
        <li>Learn well in problem solving or creative situations</li>
        <li>Sees the whole picture with overlapping parts</li>
        <li>Prefer a busy environment and work area</li>
        <li>Produce real, but creative, products</li>

      <p>All of these things are true of me and speak to the way I think and learn. I've definitely struggled in the first 3 weeks at Dev Bootcamp, and I've also made some tremendous progress. Let me share what the biggest struggles for each week of DBC. It's almost too beautiful how easily I can break down my top three struggles, framing it in the Concrete Random style of thinking/learning.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-head">Week #1, Struggle #1: What is the whole picture?</p>
      <p>The first week of DBC was tough because I didn't know what to expect and I wasn't sure where we were going. I didn't have access to the "curriculum" beyond the first three weeks and it seemed like we were covering a lot of ground in a short amount of time, and I wasn't sure where to focus my attention. Thus, I had trouble prioritizing (a classic struggle of a Concrete Random). Sigh--I'm so cliche...
      <p class="paragraph-head">Week #2, Struggle #2: I forgot how to learn.</p>
      <p>Week #2 was much more difficult for me. It required many more hours than I had expected and I was freaking out because I felt like I had forgotten how to learn. Apparently, Concrete Randoms are self-directed learners and I lost touch with how to do that. I left my last job in September and had been traveling for 3 months. A small identity crisis? But it thankfully it didn't last long.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-head">Week #3, Struggle #3: Choosing just one answer...no thank you.</p> Week #3 had a slew of exercises that were super fun and awesome and I spent SO MUCH TIME on each one because I felt like there were multiple answers and I wasn't sure I did it the best way. Guess what, apparently this is typical of Concrete Randoms. We (yeah, I feel better talking about us as a whole rather than just myself) like to test things for ourselves and work through problems by ourselves. So it was hard to pair with others when I really wanted to do it on my own...or rather, do it a few ways on my own.</p>

      <p class="paragraph-head">Going forward!</p>
      <p>The plan going forward? Keep on keeping on! I think it's great to keep in mind what my styles and preferences might be and maybe more importantly, what other people's styles and preferences might be. But honestly, I feel like I'm in good shape: I know what the big picture is now, I've re-learned how to learn, and well...I guess I'll have to work on committing to a single solution. :)</p>
