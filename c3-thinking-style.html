      <p>I ___ x 4 =    Concrete Sequential (CS)
         II ___ x 4 =    Abstract Sequential (AS)
         III ___ x 4 =   Abstract Random (AR)
         IV ___ x 4 =    Concrete Random (CR)</p>
      <p>"Like concrete sequentials, they're based in reality, but are willing to take more of a trial-and-error approach. Because of this, they often make the intuitive leaps necessary for true creative thought. They have a strong need to find alternatives and do things in their own way." If you're a CR, use your divergent thinking ability. Believe that it's good to see things from more than one viewpoint. Put yourself in a position to solve problems. But give yourself deadlines. Accept your need for change. Try and work with people who value divergent thinking.</p>
      <p>What has been the biggest struggle for you? Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else? If it's related to your learning style, start thinking of strategies to help you. Put some plans of action in place.</p>
