      <p>This is an assignment about conflict. What happened? What did we learn?</p>
      <p>Let me quickly set the scene:</p>
      <p>Last year, I was invited by some of my more inspiring and epic friends to hike the Grand Canyon in 24 hours. I had missed the previous year's "Sufferfest" event because of a new job so I was especially excited to be able to partcipate. I invited a friend from college (one of the only other masochists I knew) to join the ~30 other people making the trek to GC.</p>
      <p>The other major things you must know are:</p>
      <p class="indent">(1) The Grand Canyon's rim-to-rim hike is 22 miles.</p>
      <p class="indent">(2) There were 3 organized groups. There were people who would...</p>
      <p class="indent-indent">(R2R-24) hike from the south rim to the north rim, camp, and then get driven back to the south rim</p>
      <p class="indent-indent">(R2R2R-48) hike from the south rim to the north rim, camp, and hike back to the south rim the following day</li>
      <p class="indent-indent">(R2R2R-24) hike from the south rim to the north rim and then back to the south rim all in the same day</p>
      <p class="indent">(3) There was a large group of people going and I only know 4 or 5 people. My friend only knew 1 (--> me).</p>

      <p>My friend, let's call him Jet, lives in LA and we were keeping in touch and discussing our trip to the Grand Canyon together every so often via phone and text. We were both hoping to do the rim-to-rim-to-rim in 24 hours (R2R2R-24) but the week before the trip, he called to say his knee had been bothering him and we would see how he felt when we got there.</p>
      <p>To fast-forward to the day of the hike, we decided that morning that we wanted to do the whole thing in a day but because of his injury, we would take the 2-day option.</p>
      <div class="image2"></div>
      <p>Our conflict occurred as we were approaching the north rim at around 3pm. We led the pack of 20-something people in the R2R2R-48 group, which tempted me to suggest we consider pushing through and completing the whole treak in 24 hours. Jet is a seasoned mountaineer and an adventurer who appreciates pushing one's limits. When he said he did not feel comfortable pushing through, I asked him if he would be okay with me going on on my own. My question offended Jet and really upset him, which surprised me. We discussed the issue for the remainder of the stretch (maybe 3 miles up the side of the canyon) and were frustrated with one another by the time we reached the top.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-head">Ultimately, we both felt that the other was being selfish.</p>
      <p>I felt that Jet was being selfish because I had trained for months to do the R2R2R in 24 hours and had been looking forward to this epic adventure for really 2 years now. I wanted to challenge myself physically and mentally and I thought of all people, he would understand that.</p>
      <p>Jet felt that I was being selfish. I had invited him on this trip and we were doing this together. He didn't know anyone else but me and as a good friend, a good travel partner, a good adventure companion, he expected me to stay with him and never even consider abandoning him.</p>
      <p>We ended up both continuing on and completing 42 miles in 22 hours. Jet was...incredibly inspiring as he did it with injuries and it was for sure, one of the most physically and mentally difficult things I've done.</p>
      <div class="image3"></div>
      <p>As long time friends, we talked about our misunderstanding exhaustively during our drive back to LA. We learned a lot about one another and how we prioritized people and experiences. And I for one also learned a lot about myself.</p>
      <p>Over the years, I've learned that compromising sometimes costs more than I initially expect. There have been many times where I really want to do something and decide to appease someone else instead. I end up feeling good that I made the "right choice" at first but I find myself regreting my decision...and sometimes, it eats me up from the inside out. I find myself wishing I had chosen to put myself first and sometimes, I even start to resent the person I made the sacrifice for.</p>
      <p>Consciously or not, I've made many friends who understand this about me and also feel the same way. We support and encourage one another to "do you" because we believe that you must take care of number one first, before being able to share your best self with the ones you love. The real take-home for me though was to make sure this isn't implicit and communicating what my wants and desires are honestly, openly, and most importantly, early.</p>
