      <p>I am going to explain how to use the group_by method the way I wished it was explained to me.</p>
      <p> group_by is a method that...</p>
      <ol>
        <li>-  can be used to group integers or strings</li>
        <li>-  is called by either an array or hash</li>
        <li>-  is more powerful when followed by a block specifying how the user wants to group information</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="paragraph-head">Example #1 : An array of integers</p>
      <p>I have an array of all the ages of my team members. I want to do a bar crawl but wait...is everyone old enough?</p>
      <img src="images/t4-enumerable-methods-images/image-1.png"/>

      <p>You can see that I've called the group_by method on my array of ages. The block that I've passed looks for ages that are old enough to (legally) drink, and you can see group_by has separated the ages by those that pass true and false in the block. </p>

    <p class="paragraph-head">Example #1 (continued): An array of integers + group labels</p>
      <p>You can also specify how you'd like to label each group by editing the block. Below, I am using the exact same array as before but replacing "true" and "false" with "Party Peoples!" and "Too Young..." respectively.</p>

      <p class="paragraph-head">Example #2 : A hash with strings and integers</p>
      <p>So now I know that 2 of my teammates can't go to the bars with me, but...who are they? Below, I've created a hash with the names of the people whose ages we were previously looking at.</p>

      <p>I can call the group_by method to my hash just like I did with my array to get the names of my underaged friends. (Maybe I shouldn't even both inviting them.)</p>

      <p class="paragraph-head">Example #2 (continued) : A hash with strings and integers + randomly assigning groups</p>
      <p>After much thought...it'd be really sad for Abbey and Emerson to not be able to join us simply because of their age. So instead, why don't I just host something at my place? I'll provide the drinks and people can bring whatever they want. Or better yet! I can randomly group them to bring chasers and snacks.</p>

      <p>I hope that helps explain how the group_by method works. Let me know if I missed something or if anything was confusing!</p>
