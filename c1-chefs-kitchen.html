      &nbsp; Could I be any more excited about Dev Bootcamp?!!

        &nbsp; ON THE RESTAURANT VERSUS KITCHEN: Dope analogy. Are you a customer, ordering off a menu, expecting to get what you think you paid for? Or are you in the kitchen, experimenting and creating with your own two hands? For the last 6 weeks (or however long since I was accepted in DBC) I've been wishing and hoping that it'll be early enough for me to have influence and have a voice but expecting it to be already somewhat rigid and set in stone. I love the small startup feel in that you get hired to be a part of the evolution, not to be a cog in the wheel. Am I nervous? Sorta kinda maybe...but in the best way possible. I know that I will definitely sit into that consumer seat from time to time but I am genuinely eager to be in a melting pot with a bunch of other crazies who decided to take a leap and change things up in their lives.

        &nbsp; ON FEAR: I suffer from the imposter syndrome. I don't know if it's because I'm a woman or because I care too much about what other people think about me or maybe it's just a normal insecurity of anyones. Regardless, I've been focusing a lot of my personal growth in the past several years on killing this thing. And I think a learning environment like DBC will really test how much progress I've made.

      &nbsp; The whole reason why I left my last job and the reason why I chose to join Dev Bootcamp is culture. It is incredibly important to me; it means everything to me. I am really excited to be a part of a community that values the same things as me.
